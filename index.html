              Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our 
              body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole determinant 
              of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point to evaluate 
              your overall health and well-being.

                    A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a 
                    healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on, 
                    such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced 
                    fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, 
                    strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for 
                    five days a week.
